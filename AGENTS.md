This repository contains Chabeau, an open source (CC-0) chatbot TUI for remote API-based access.

When contributing, please prioritize these guidelines:

- Follow best practices for Rust development and build/test/release processes.
- Ensure new functionality does not introduce usability, security or accessibility regressions.
- Add unit tests opportunistically.
- Update the README.md after you've completed the main objective.
- Always run `cargo test`, `cargo check`, `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` after you've completed the main objective.
- Feel free to suggest changes to WISHLIST.md after all these steps have been completed. Thanks for making Chabeau better!

Additional style note for agents:
- Do not leave breadcrumb comments about past changes (e.g., "removed", "replaced", or historical notes in code). Keep comments focused on current behavior and intent only.
